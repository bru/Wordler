# Welcome to Wordler

...that is just a proof of concept sinatra app to serve wordle-like word clouds.

The algorithm is heavily inspired by Netlife's FatCloud plugin for Wordpress (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/netlifes-tag-cloud-fatcloud/).

Image generation relies on rmagick.

## Dependencies

Wordlr needs the following gems:

* rmagick
* haml
* sass
* json

...and of course sinatra

## Usage

    ruby wordcloud.rb

...and connect to localhost:4567
